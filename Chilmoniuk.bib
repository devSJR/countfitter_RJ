	abstract = {The analysis of different biomolecules is of prime importance for life science research and medical diagnostics. Due to the discovery of new molecules and new emerging bioanalytical problems, there is an ongoing demand for a technology platform that provides a broad range of assays with a user-friendly flexibility and rapid adaptability to new applications. Here we describe a highly versatile microscopy platform, VideoScan, for the rapid and simultaneous analysis of various assay formats based on fluorescence microscopic detection. The technological design is equally suitable for assays in solution, microbead-based assays and cell pattern recognition. The multiplex real-time capability for tracking of changes under dynamic heating conditions makes it a useful tool for PCR applications and nucleic acid hybridization, enabling kinetic data acquisition impossible to obtain by other technologies using endpoint detection. The paper discusses the technological principle of the platform regarding data acquisition and processing. Microbead-based and solution applications for the detection of diverse biomolecules, including antigens, antibodies, peptides, oligonucleotides and amplicons in small reaction volumes, are presented together with a high-content detection of autoimmune antibodies using a HEp-2 cell assay. Its adaptiveness and versatility gives VideoScan a competitive edge over other bioanalytical technologies.},

	abstract = {Antibody assessment is an essential part in the serological diagnosis of autoimmune diseases. However, different diagnostic strategies have been proposed for the work up of sera in particular from patients with systemic autoimmune rheumatic disease (SARD). In general, screening for SARD-associated antibodies by indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) is followed by confirmatory testing covering different assay techniques. Due to lacking automation, standardization, modern data management, and human bias in IIF screening, this two-stage approach has recently been challenged by multiplex techniques particularly in laboratories with high workload. However, detection of antinuclear antibodies by IIF is still recommended to be the gold standard method for antibody screening in sera from patients with suspected SARD. To address the limitations of IIF and to meet the demand for cost-efficient autoantibody screening, automated IIF methods employing novel pattern recognition algorithms for image analysis have been introduced recently. In this respect, the AKLIDES technology has been the first commercially available platform for automated interpretation of cell-based IIF testing and provides multiplexing by addressable microbead immunoassays for confirmatory testing. This paper gives an overview of recently published studies demonstrating the advantages of this new technology for SARD serology.},

	abstract = {R is a free open-source implementation of the S statistical computing language and programming environment. The current status of R is a command line driven interface with no advanced cross-platform graphical user interface (GUI), but it includes tools for building such. Over the past years, proprietary and non-proprietary GUI solutions have emerged, based on internal or external tool kits, with different scopes and technological concepts. For example, Rgui.exe and Rgui.app have become the de facto GUI on the Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X platforms, respectively, for most users. In this paper we discuss RKWard which aims to be both a comprehensive GUI and an integrated development environment for R. RKWard is based on the KDE software libraries. Statistical procedures and plots are implemented using an extendable plugin architecture based on ECMAScript (JavaScript), R, and XML. RKWard provides an excellent tool to manage different types of data objects; even allowing for seamless editing of certain types. The objective of RKWard is to provide a portable and extensible R interface for both basic and advanced statistical and graphical analysis, while not compromising on flexibility and modularity of the R programming environment itself.},

	volume = {3},
	url = {http://jlpm.amegroups.com/article/view/4370},
	abstract = {Background:  DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) are the most severe form of DNA damage in eukaryotic cells treated with ionizing radiation or chemotherapeutic drugs. They can be quantitatively assessed by fluorescence imaging of phosphorylated histone protein H2AX (γH2AX), where the number of γH2AX foci represents the number of DNA DSB. Real-time assessment of DSB could help tailoring cytotoxic therapies to individual patients regarding both response and adverse events. This would require reliable automated quantification technology not yet routinely available. Here we explore this concept in the context of malignant lymphoma.
 Methods:  To investigate the DSB response to cytotoxic treatment  in vitro , peripheral lymphocytes of healthy donors were incubated with bendamustine, an alkylating drug commonly used in lymphoma therapy. To mimic the clinical setting, the drug concentration per number of donor cells was either calculated as a standard dose or based on the body surface area of the individual donor. DNA DSB were quantified by an automatized immunofluorescence γH2AX assay using the AKLIDES NUK ®  system.
 Results:  Across all donors, the mean number of γH2AX foci per cell was 1.29, IQR (1.08) after bendamustine treatment as opposed to 0.04, IQR (0.125) in untreated freshly isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). The standardized incubation dosage resulted in a mean of 0.89, IQR (0.51) foci per cell, while individualized dose calculation yielded 1.57, IQR (0.5) foci per cell. The difference in γH2AX foci between the two dosage calculations was significant (P=0.036). In addition, we observed a trend towards a negative correlation between the donors’ body surface area and the number of foci per cell. Between donors, no significant correlation of the number of foci in response to a given dose was observed. Dose titrations on the cells of individual donors demonstrated a significant response (P Conclusions:  The automatic AKLIDES analysis platform can assess γH2AX foci for routine use. The individual γH2AX foci response to  in vitro  bendamustine is dose-dependent and can be monitored timely. Calculating individual  in vitro  dosage from the donor’s body surface area resulted in a broad variation of foci counts between individuals, suggesting that this dosage method does not result in equivalent biological effects among different individuals. Adjusting the dose individually based on biological responses such as DNA DSB could offer a way of personalized medicine with conventional substances, reducing toxicity while increasing therapeutic efficacy.},

	abstract = {Precision or personalized medicine is an aspiring but controversially discussed new paradigm in modern medicine. The individual variability of patients and their diverse responses to treatment options casts doubt on “one-fits-all” therapeutic strategies. Thus, biomarker-based stratification of patients into smaller cohorts is recommended. Indeed, the enormous progress in “omics” technologies has greatly supported this medical model which focused on determining disease predisposition, delivering early and targeted prevention, and/or tailoring the right therapy for each patient at the right time. Especially in the field of precision cancer therapy, the growing understanding of tumor heterogeneity and individual treatment responses has enabled the identification of adequate biomarkers. This review focuses on biomarkers for genotoxicity assessment by different methods, their characteristics, technical advances and their potential clinical applications.},
